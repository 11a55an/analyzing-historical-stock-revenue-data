# Stock and Revenue Data Analysis Dashboard with Python

## Project Overview
In this project, I will step into the shoes of a Data Scientist / Data Analyst working for a startup investment firm specializing in helping customers invest in stocks. My task is to gather financial data, including historical share prices and quarterly revenue reports, from various sources using Python libraries and web scraping for popular stocks. After collecting this data, I will visualize it in a dashboard to uncover patterns and trends. The primary stocks under consideration are Tesla and GameStop.

## Dashboard Analytics Displayed
A well-designed dashboard provides a concise view of key performance indicators. This project emphasizes the analysis of a dataset and extraction of key performance indicators. It also involves utilizing prompts to facilitate learning in data access and visualization on dashboards. The project covers displaying essential performance indicators on a dashboard. Although Plotly is used for data visualization in this project, it's not mandatory to have prior experience with it.

## Tools and Technologies
For this project, I will leverage Python libraries and web scraping techniques to collect data and Plotly for visualization. It's important to note that familiarity with Plotly is beneficial but not a prerequisite.

## Watson Studio and Skills Network Labs
This project is part of the "IBM Python Project For Data Science" course on Coursera and will be implemented using Skills Network Labs and Watson Studio. Skills Network Labs provides a practical environment for learning and completing labs associated with various courses. On the other hand, Watson Studio, a component of IBM Cloud Pak for Data, offers a suite of tools and a collaborative environment for data professionals to develop and deploy projects.
